Consists of 3 folders for TT,FF and SS corner
TT - typical NMOS typical PMOS - nominal case
FF - fast NMOS fast PMOS - best case
SS - slow NMOS slow PMOS - worst case
Programs to find the propagation delay in all the three process corners are written
Delay table prepared for all the 3 corners
Capacitive load = 10fF and input slew = 0.1ns
Based on the differnce between the rise and fall delay the transistor of particular size is use for different application
Rise delay ~= to fall delay, best for clock network
Others can be use for data path depending upon the requirement
(w/l)p = 2.5(w/l)n, considered best for clock network
